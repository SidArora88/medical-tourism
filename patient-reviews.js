        review: "I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which has a very poor prognosis. Pancreatic surgery expertise in Kuwait was limited, and I needed the best possible surgeon. Dr. Rela at Global Hospital performed Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) to remove the tumor. The complex 8-hour surgery was successful with no complications. Pathology showed complete cancer removal. I'm now 4 years cancer-free and living normally.",

This condition is fatal without surgery, but no facility in Guinea could treat it. We brought our baby to Fortis Escorts where Dr. Trehan performed the first stage of Norwood procedure. The surgery saved our baby's life. After three staged surgeries, our child now has normal heart function and is thriving.",
